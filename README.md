# videoPlaylist

Same JS app that reads an array of [api.video](https://api.video)  videoIds.  Creates a video player, and then when the video is done - destroys the player, and creates a new player - with the next videoId

This essentially creates a "playlist"  Each video in the array will be played: one after another.
